## Data Visualization of Brasileirão Cup

Project consists in a map centralized over Brazil, where the user can select
various different filters based in many metrics related to the Brasileirão Cup
(Example: State with most number of victories) being able to create comparisons
between data. Furthermore, the user can also select a state on which
he can apply most of the same metrics and comparisons he applied for the whole country,
but specified for the state in question.


## Branch Names

Each branch should be named after the feature/issue it solves.
For example: "feature-#X_(description)" or "issue-#X_(description)"
Where X is the number of the solved issue

In case there is no issue associated to the commit, simply remove the issue number from the commit.
For example: "feature-(description)"
