## Data Visualization of Brasileirão Cup (2014 - 2016)

Project consists in a map centralized over Brazil, where the user can select
various different filters based in many metrics related to the Brasileirão Cup
(Example: State with most number of victories) being able to create comparisons
between data of each year. Furthermore, the user can also select a state on which
he can apply most of the same metrics and comparisons he applied for the whole country,
but specified for the state in question.
